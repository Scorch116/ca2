<h1>What is bootstrap?</h1>
<p>Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project..</p>
<P></P>
<p>I have been asked for my second CA in interactive media desgin to design and devlop a online CV website while using Boottrap feature as a base. I will use to blank HTML page to explain those features. </p>

<h1>Bootstrap containers </h1>
<p>container is used to set the content's margins dealing with the responsive behaviors of your layout. It contains the row elements and the row elements are the container of columns (known as grid system). The container class is used to create boxed content. This will be the main chunk of my online CV</p>

<h1>Bootstrap images</h1>
<p>Images in Bootstrap are made responsive with . img-fluid . max-width: 100%; and height: auto; are applied to the image so that it scales with the parent element. Responsive image. I used bootstrap images to make my main photo circle shaped as it is more plesant to the eye ,The .rounded-circle class shapes the image to a circle. </p>

<h1>Progress bar</h1>
<p>The progress bar was very usefull , the  progress bar can be used to show a user how far along i am in a process or my ability to rate my skills such as coding languages and other IT skills</p>
<P></P>
<h1>Button groups</h1>
<p>Button groups allow multiple buttons to be stacked together on a single line. This is useful when you want to place items like alignment buttons together. You can add on optional JavaScript radio and checkbox style behavior with Bootstrap Button Plugin, I used these featue to provide links to useful resources such as Linkedin and github profiles</p>

<h1>The Navbars</h1>
<p>With Bootstrap, a navigation bar can extend or collapse, depending on the screen size.The Bootstrap navigation bar is created with the .navbar class, followed by a responsive collapsing class: .navbar-expand-xl|lg|md|sm</p>
